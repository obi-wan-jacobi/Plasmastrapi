general framework quirks:
- this.__engine cannot be used in constructor methods because the engine instance has not yet been injected
- Entities/EventEmiters will not be added to their respective Container until they have had their engine instance injected

needs testing:
- destroy->purge

in progress:
- wire collision bounds is weird in the top right corner of a wire that is angle slightly downward left to right
- button hotkeys
- gate logic
- undo/redo
- copy/paste
	
missing features:
- lab scene
	- elements
		- flip flops (x3)
		- timers
		- SOCs + contexts/scene controller (tabs? overlay?)
	- design editor
		- save/load design
		- drag-select multiple elements
		- undo/redo
		- copy/paste
		- wire routing
		- rotatable components
		- zoom in/out
		- resize with window
	- circuit testing ("debug" mode)
		- pause/stop/play
		- breakpoints?
		- step forward/backward
		- sliding global timer
- game menu (MainMenu Scene)
	- UI panels
	- UI buttons with text labels

known issues:
- 

user experience:
- 

tech debt:
- mesh component point collision checking is disgusting
- add comments/documentation
- EventEmitter mixins should check for an engine instance before being loaded/activated
- blue background image is needlessly large
- require.js --> configure paths for easier module loading
- project manifest
	- debug mode
		- inject style templates into all drawable objects
		- draw collision boundaries
- run memory analysis/profiler diagnostics
- JSDocs/automated documentation
- unit tests

optimization
- MeshComponent --> combine translate + rotate into one function (leverage a single forloop)?
- AtomicKeyPairArray --> store this.__end to avoid O(n) for this.push
- PickableTraits should be put on entities and not pickable components
- Tool life cycle
- entity destruction (EventEmitterContainer --> destroyed entities unsubscribe from their own components, etc.)

scalability concerns:
- single-canvas viewport

technology:
- linting
	- ESlint (http://eslint.org/)
	- intellisense typings (vscode)
- unit tests
	- jasmine
	- travis CI (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs)
- grunt
- bower
- npm
- node
- mongo
- projectz for readme files (https://github.com/bevry/projectz)
