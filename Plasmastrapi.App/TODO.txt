in progress:
- wireTool logic
	- disallow multiple wires between the same two terminals
	
missing features:
- lab scene
	- flip flops (x3)
	- timers
		- sliding global timer
	- SOCs + contexts/scene controller (tabs? overlay?)
	- save/load design
		- breakpoint
	- wire routing
	- rotatable components
	- play, pause, step, rewind
	- undo/redo
- game menu (MainMenu Scene)
	- UI panels
	- UI buttons with text labels
- zoom in/out
	- window resize

user experience:
- 

tech debt:
- code smell in scenes.js
	- we have to rely on addEventListener 'oninit' for initializing scenes?
- DI framework for engine-instance injection
- EventEmitter::DynamicallyShrinkableSubscriberArray should be refactored as multiple 'functional' object classes
	- purge contains its own for-loop (not functional programming!)
- project manifest
	- debug mode
		- inject style templates into all drawable objects
		- draw collision boundaries
- give canvas tabIndex so we can addEventListener for keyboard events/focus
	- http://www.dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/canvas/CanvasKeyEvents.html
	- nothing should ever touch window (save for index.html)
- naming conventions (service, controller, system, etc...)
	- rename subdirectories to be classes, mixins, singletons, etc. instead of just 'core'
- throwing exceptions (refactor using a framework)
- run memory analysis/profiler diagnostics
- refactor for better memory (closures, prototype functions, function caching)
- unit tests
- JSDocs/automated documentation

scalability concerns:
- single-canvas viewport

known issues:
- asset loading -- images set to load last are 'loaded' with 0 width and height

technology:
- ECMAScript 6
	- traceur/babel transpiler
	- Closure Compiler
- linting
	- ESlint (http://eslint.org/)
	- intellisense typings (vscode)
- unit tests
	- jasmine
	- travis CI (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs)
- grunt
- bower
- npm
- node
- mongo
- projectz for readme files (https://github.com/bevry/projectz)
