known issues:
- 

needs testing:
- undo/redo non-trivial cases (restoring wires on destroyed logic elements, restoring wires on moved logic elements, etc.)
- (cache performance) undo/redo

in progress:
	- circuit testing ('debug' mode)
		- pause/stop/play
		- breakpoints?
		- step forward/backward
		- sliding global timer (signal propagation speed)

wtf:
	- PickComponentContainer

tech debt:
- general
	- (ongoing) run memory analysis/profiler diagnostics
- tools
	- (SelectionBoxController): destroySelectionBox is called before endSelectionBoxPlacement
- circuits
	- config
- scenes
	- config
- ui
	- config
- engine
	- refactor AssetLoader to use a Loader base class
- optimization
	- refactor all *** closures *** to be prototypal
	- PolygonHandle point-collision checking is disgusting
	- PolygonComponent --> combine translate + rotate into one function (leverage a single for-loop)?
- scalability concerns
	- constrain upper limit to revision cache
	- single-canvas viewport

backlog:
- general
	- resize with window
- ui
	- Refactor such that panel content/child positions are relative to parent (percent-based or position-based)
		- ViewportSystem to listen for screen resize events?
	- Modal panels (move, stretch/resize, close)
- lab scene
	- design editor
		- save/load design
		- rotatable components
		- wire routing
	- scenario window
		- zoom in/out
		- environment
	- elements
		- flip flops (x3)
		- timers
		- SOCs + design contexts (tabs? overlay?)
