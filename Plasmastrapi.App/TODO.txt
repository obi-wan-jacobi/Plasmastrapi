general framework quirks:
- this.__engine cannot be used in constructor methods because the engine instance has not yet been injected
- Entities/EventEmiters will not be added to their respective Container until they have had their engine instance injected

needs testing:
- destroy->purge

in progress:
- wireTool logic
	- disallow multiple wires between the same two terminals
	
missing features:
- lab scene
	- elements
		- flip flops (x3)
		- timers
		- SOCs + contexts/scene controller (tabs? overlay?)
	- design editor
		- save/load design
		- drag-select multiple elements
		- undo/redo
		- copy/paste
		- wire routing
		- rotatable components
		- zoom in/out
		- resize with window
	- circuit testing ("debug" mode)
		- pause/stop/play
		- breakpoints?
		- step forward/backward
		- sliding global timer
- game menu (MainMenu Scene)
	- UI panels
	- UI buttons with text labels

user experience:
- 

tech debt:
- blue background image is needlessly large
- require.js -- use key names rather than file paths
- project manifest
	- debug mode
		- inject style templates into all drawable objects
		- draw collision boundaries
- run memory analysis/profiler diagnostics
- JSDocs/automated documentation
- unit tests

scalability concerns:
- single-canvas viewport

known issues:
- asset loading -- images set to load last are 'loaded' with 0 width and height

technology:
- linting
	- ESlint (http://eslint.org/)
	- intellisense typings (vscode)
- unit tests
	- jasmine
	- travis CI (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs)
- grunt
- bower
- npm
- node
- mongo
- projectz for readme files (https://github.com/bevry/projectz)
