tech debt:
- general
	- run memory analysis/profiler diagnostics
- circuits
	- config
- scenes
	- config
- ui
	- config
- engine
	- refactor AssetLoader to use a Loader class
- optimization
	- refactor all *** closures *** to be prototypal
	- PolygonHandle point-collision checking is disgusting
	- PolygonComponent --> combine translate + rotate into one function (leverage a single for-loop)?
	- component destruction (EmitterContainer --> destroyed components are unsubscribed from their host entity before post-destruction callbacks resolve)
	- dependent/child entity destruction (EmitterContainer --> destroyed dependent/child entities are unsubscribed from their host/parent entity before post-destruction callbacks resolve)
- potential scalability concerns
	- single-canvas viewport

backlog:
- general
	- resize with window
- ui
	- Refactor such that panel content/child positions are relative to parent (percent-based or position-based)
		- ViewportSystem to listen for screen resize events?
	- Modal panels (move, stretch/resize, close)
- lab scene
	- scenario window
		- zoom in/out
		- environment
		- events	
	- design editor
		- wire 'draw-cutting'
		- confine circuit elements to design area
			- highlight/outline selected tool
		- copy/paste
		- rotatable components
		- save/load design
		- undo/redo
		- wire routing
	- circuit testing ('debug' mode)
		- pause/stop/play
		- breakpoints?
		- step forward/backward
		- sliding global timer (signal propagation speed)
	- elements
		- flip flops (x3)
		- timers
		- SOCs + design contexts (tabs? overlay? panels?)
