known issues:
- 

user experience:
- terminals are selectable when the circuit element is inside a selection-box

needs testing:
- destroy->purge

overhaul:
- engine
	- pick system
	- draw container
- game
	- factories
		- handle/component dependencies
		- containers
		- refactor compatibility decorations
- Refactor UI such that panel content/child positions are relative to parent (percent-based or position-based)
	- ViewportSystem to listen for screen resize events?
- Modal panels (move, stretch, close)

tech debt:
- require dependencies for type-checking in Component and DataHandle
- dictionaries validate type for key as well as value
- mixin superclass
- meshhandle point-collision checking is disgusting
- run memory analysis/profiler diagnostics
- JSDocs/automated documentation
- unit tests

optimization
- tool compatibility filtering --> sort pickable components using a tree?
- MeshComponent --> combine translate + rotate into one function (leverage a single for-loop)?
- Dictionary --> store this.__end to avoid O(n) for this.add
- entity destruction (EmitterContainer --> destroyed entities unsubscribe from their own components, etc.)

scalability concerns:
- single-canvas viewport

in progress:
- 

backlog:
- general
	- resize with window
- game menu
	- UI panels
	- menu buttons with text labels 
- lab scene
	- scenario window
		- zoom in/out
		- environment
		- events	
	- design editor
		- wire 'draw-cutting'
		- confine circuit elements to design area
			- highlight/outline selected tool
		- copy/paste
		- rotatable components
		- save/load design
		- undo/redo
		- wire routing
	- circuit testing ('debug' mode)
		- pause/stop/play
		- breakpoints?
		- step forward/backward
		- sliding global timer (signal propagation speed)
	- elements
		- flip flops (x3)
		- timers
		- SOCs + design contexts (tabs? overlay? panels?)
- config
	- scenes
